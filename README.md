## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- *Vehicle Weight* & *Ground Clearance* provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. This means that both of those variables had an effect on mpg in the MechaCar.

- The slope of the linear model is not zero because the *p-value is 5.35e-11*, which is very low. A p-value below the significance level of .05 gives us sufficent evidence to reject the null hypothesis, and tells us that the slope of this linear model is not zero.

- This linear model could predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes relatively effectively given the *R-squared value of 0.7149*. This means that ~72% of the observed variation can be explained by the model's inputs.



For the final deliverable, write up a short description of the study design for additional statistical analysis.
